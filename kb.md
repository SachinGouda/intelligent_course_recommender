## Python vs R for Data Science
- Python: broader ecosystem (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow), great for production/ML engineering and end-to-end pipelines.
- R: strong in statistics, academic analysis, and visualization (ggplot2, tidyverse). Common in bio/academia.

**Rule of thumb:** If your goal is ML engineering, product work, or deploying models, start with Python. If your goal is statistical analysis/research, R can be a strong first choice.

## Steps to become an ML Engineer
1. Foundations: Python, data structures/algorithms, Linux, Git.
2. Math: Linear algebra, calculus (basics), probability & statistics.
3. Core ML: Supervised/unsupervised learning, model evaluation, feature engineering.
4. Deep Learning: CNNs, RNNs/Transformers; frameworks like PyTorch/TensorFlow.
5. MLOps: Experiment tracking, CI/CD, containers, orchestration, monitoring & drift.
6. Projects: 3–5 end-to-end portfolio projects (incl. a deployed app + README).
7. Domain: Choose a vertical (NLP/CV/Time Series) and build depth.
8. Interview prep: DSA basics, system design for ML, case studies.

## RAG & LLM Application Tips
- Chunk text (~500–1000 tokens), embed with SentenceTransformers or OpenAI.
- Use vector DB (FAISS/Chroma). Include metadata (source, tags).
- Build prompt with user profile context + retrieved passages; set temperature low for factual responses.
- Add evaluation: retrieval precision@k, groundedness checks.

## Learning Path Templates
- **Data Scientist (Python-first):** Python -> Statistics -> SQL -> EDA -> ML -> Visualization -> Projects -> MLOps.
- **ML Engineer (NLP focus):** Python -> Math -> ML -> Deep Learning -> Transformers/NLP -> RAG -> MLOps -> Deploy project.
- **Data Engineer (ML-inclined):** SQL -> Python -> Data Warehousing -> Spark -> Orchestration (Airflow) -> Cloud -> ML basics.

## Career Advice & Specializations
- Data Analyst: Excel -> SQL -> Python/R -> Visualization (Tableau/PowerBI) -> Business Fundamentals -> Projects.
- AI Product Manager: Domain knowledge -> Data basics -> ML concepts -> Stakeholder management -> Ethics & Responsible AI.
- Research Scientist: R/Python -> Advanced statistics -> Academic writing -> Experiment design -> Publishing papers.

## Popular Tools & Platforms
